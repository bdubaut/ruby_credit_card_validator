ruby_credit_card_validator
==========================

A command line credit card validator written in Ruby

### How to use
- clone the project
- run bundle install (I recommand creating a .rvmrc file first, specifying the a gemset. I like to do that so my ruby development environment is always clean)
- in your terminal, run <pre><code>ruby validator.rb</code></pre>
- play with it

Here are some valid and invalid card numbers
